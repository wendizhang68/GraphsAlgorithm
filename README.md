# GraphsAlgorithm
I wrote a library package to provide facilities for manipulating graphs, plus two clients that use the package.
Clients include:
Makefile and TripFinder
Two clients are implemented using the Graph package.
Feel free to try visualizing DFS, BFS, Dijsktra's, and several different Traversal Algorithms!
